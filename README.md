## @dragonlabs/react-ui-components

This is a collection of React + Bootstrap UI components that I use in some of my other projects, such as [macro-tracker](https://github.com/markormesher/macro-tracker) and [money-dashboard](https://github.com/markormesher/money-dashboard). I publish them to NPM to avoid duplication between my projects, which means that some aspects of them are opinionated to fit my needs and preferences. This package isn't intended for widespread use, but if you can get some value out of it, feel free!

### Why "dragonlabs"?

It was late and I needed a name. DragonLabs is a reference to an old project and was the first thing that came to mind.
